                  atomistic simulations is a surprisingly difficult problem that
                  has found no satisfactory solution for more than 15 years. The
                  reason is that the charging free energies evaluated from such
                  simulations are affected by very large errors. One of these is
                  related to the choice of a specific convention for summing up
                  the contributions of solvent charges to the electrostatic
                  potential in the ionic cavity, namely, on the basis of point
                  charges within entire solvent molecules (M scheme) or on the
                  basis of individual point charges (P scheme). The use of an
                  inappropriate convention may lead to a charge-independent
                  offset in the calculated potential, which depends on the
                  details of the summation scheme, on the quadrupole-moment
                  trace of the solvent molecule, and on the approximate form
                  used to represent electrostatic interactions in the
                  system. However, whether the M or P scheme (if any) represents
                  the appropriate convention is still a matter of on-going
                  debate. The goal of the present article is to settle this
                  long-standing controversy by carefully analyzing (both
                  analytically and numerically) the properties of the
                  electrostatic potential in molecular liquids (and inside
                  cavities within them).},

                  (i.e. a flow with a large amount of data to send, such as FTP
                  transfers) may be characterized by three quantities. The first
                  is the send rate, which is the amount of data sent by the
                  sender in unit time. The second is the throughput, which is
                  the amount of data received by the receiver in unit time. Note
                  that the throughput will always be less than or equal to the
                  send rate due to losses. Finally, the number of non-duplicate
                  packets received by the receiver in unit time gives us the
                  goodput of the connection. The goodput is always less than or
                  equal to the throughput, since the receiver may receive two
                  copies of the same packet due to retransmissions by the
                  sender. In a previous paper, we presented a simple model for
                  predicting the steady state send rate of a bulk transfer TCP
                  flow as a function of loss rate and round trip time. In this
                  paper, we extend that work in two ways. First, we analyze the
                  performance of bulk transfer TCP flows using more precise,
                  stochastic analysis. Second, we build upon the previous
                  analysis to provide both an approximate formula as well as a
                  more accurate stochastic model for the steady state throughput
                  of a bulk transfer TCP flow.},
